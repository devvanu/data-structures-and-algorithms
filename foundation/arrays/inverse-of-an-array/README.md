## Inverse Of An Array

### Easy
***

1. You are given a number n, representing the size of array a.
2. You are given n numbers, representing elements of array a.
3. You are required to calculate the inverse of array a.
4. The inverse of a number is defined as the number created by interchanging the face value and index of digits of number.
5. The key constraint is if the number is 5 digits long, it'll contain all the digits from 0 to 4 without missing any and without repeating any.
                               
**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input: </b> n = 5, a[] = {4, 0, 2, 3, 1}  
<b>Output: </b> array- {1, 4, 2, 3, 0}
</pre>

**Constraints:**
```
0 <= n < 10^7
```
