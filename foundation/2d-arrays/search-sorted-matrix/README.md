## Search In A Sorted 2d Array

### Easy
***

1. You are given a number n, representing the number of rows and columns of a square matrix.
2. You are given n \* n numbers, representing elements of 2d array a. 
3. **Note**- Each row and column is sorted in increasing order.
4. You are given a number x.
5. You are required to find x in the matrix and print it's location int (row, col) format as discussed in output format below.
6. In case element is not found, print "Not Found".

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input: </b> 
n=4, 
arr = { 11 12 13 14 
        21 22 23 24 
        31 32 33 34 
        41 42 43 44  }
<b>Output: </b> 3 2
</pre>

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= n <= 10^2
-10^9 <= e11, e12, .. n * m elements <= 10^9
All rows and columns are sorted in increasing order
```
