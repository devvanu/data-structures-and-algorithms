## Saddle Point

### Easy
***

1. You are given a square matrix of size 'n'. You are given n*n elements of the square matrix. 
2. You are required to find the saddle point of the given matrix and print the saddle point. 
3. The saddle point is defined as the least value in the row but the maximum value in the column of the matrix.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input: </b> 
n=4, 
arr = { 11 12 13 14 
        21 22 23 24 
        31 32 33 34 
        41 42 43 44  }
<b>Output: </b> 41
</pre>

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= n <= 10^2
-10^9 <= e11, e12, .. n * m elements <= 10^9
```
