## Rotate By 90 Degree

### Easy
***

1. You are given, no of rows(n) and no of columns(m)
2. You are given n\*n numbers, representing elements of 2d arrays.
3. You are required to rotate the matrix by 90 degree clockwise
4. *Note - you are required to do it in-place i.e. no extra space should be used to achieve it .*

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input: </b> n=4, arr[][] = {11, 12, 13, 14, 21, 22, 23, 24, 31, 32, 33, 34, 41, 42, 43, 44}
<b>Output: </b> 
41 31 21 11
42 32 22 12
43 33 23 13
44 34 24 14
</pre>

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= n <= 10^2
-10^9 <= e1, e2, .. n * m elements <= 10^9
```
